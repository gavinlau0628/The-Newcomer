The Newcomer is an open-world, story-based Role Play Game. The player can explore and approach objectives in the game and finish quests along the story.

You will be playing as Bruce, a novel writer who needs inspiration for his next novel and comes to this countryside village.

You liked it here and everyone is very nice to you.

However, you start to notice something is strange about this village. You tried to know more about the history, the background and the people in this village and turns out it might have some stories that surprises you.

As you finished quests and interacted with the villagers, you understood there is actually something strange going on and decided to investigate. That was when everything goes wrong...
